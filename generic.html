							<p>Getting out of my own comfort's zone and sustainable self growth is my true passion. Whether as a member of my school's throwball team captain or being selected amongst lakhs of other students while an on-campus drive , my efforts were to ace whatever I pursue. Reason? I love challenges and the self satisfactory feeling after attaining success.</p>
							<p>Bachelor's in Computer Engineering(May 2010) and later 8 years of journey as a test engineer gave me a chance to showcase my technical and interpersonal skills and undoubtedly, helped me know the IT world. But my satiety towards the newer emerging technologies and broadning my horizon urged me to take up Masters wherein I explored many courses with dozens of projects and assignments. I studied new languages, tools, technologies, business prospective, all with pretty much the same facination that drove me towards pursuing it. And it was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.
							</p>
							<p>As a professional, bagging awards every year boosted up my morale ,gave me confidence and motivated me to climb up the ladder more. So, now, in the industry, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, more problems to solve and yet more to build. And I am happy for this.
